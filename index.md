### About me

CTO [Learning Machine](learningmachine.com), Principal Architect of [Blockcerts](blockcerts.org).

### Initiatives

#### Decentralized Identifiers

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a building block of the [self-sovereign identity (SSI)](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html) stack. The [DID Draft Report](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) is under development at the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/), which I co-chair. We are working on turning this into a W3C Working Group for continued development as an international standard.

My [SSI Meetup](http://ssimeetup.org) webinar ["DIDs Demystified"](http://ssimeetup.org/dids-demystified-hands-intro-dids-btcr-did-method-kim-hamilton-duffy-webinar-5/) provides an introduction to DIDs that may be interesting for technically-oriented folks. In this webinar, I deep dive into the BTCR DID method spec, which is one of the simpler DID methods (and therefore easiest to understand from an implementation perspective). 

> Side note: [SSI Meetup](http://ssimeetup.org) has many interesting webinars on the emerging self-sovereign identity stack, which I encourage you to check out.

I worked closely with Christopher Allen, Ryan Grant, and Dan Pape to develop initial versions of the BTCR method specification. I developed the BTCR playground (which demonstrates BTCR DID lookup and creation), supporting libraries, and specifications around resolving BTCR DIDs. This is a community effort, and if you'd like to be involved, please let me know (@kimdhamilton on twitter).

#### Blockcerts

[Learning Machine](https://www.learningmachine.com/) incubated [Blockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org) with MIT Media Lab in 2016 as an open source, open standard for creating, issuing, and verifying digital records. I was principal architect and developer for this work.

The [Blockcerts Roadmap (draft)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/blockcerts_roadmap.md) describes our current focus, including adoption of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials alignment. Our paper [Open Badges are Verifiable Credentials](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/final-documents/open-badges-are-verifiable-credentials.pdf) describes Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials alignment in depth.
